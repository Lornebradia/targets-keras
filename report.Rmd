This report contains the results of our Keras model-fitting exercise. Here is a data frame summarizing all the models we tried and their test accuracies. It has one row per model.

```{r}
library(targets)
tar_load(run)
```

Summary of the model with the highest test accuracy:

```{r}
tar_read(best_run)
```

Trained Keras model object with the above hyperparameters:

```{r, paged.print = FALSE}
tar_read(best_model)
```
